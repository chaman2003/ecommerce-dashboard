Create a complete MERN E-Commerce Dashboard application using React, Material UI, Framer Motion, Recharts, and MongoDB. The entire UI must look and behave like Vision UI Pro: fully animated, glassmorphic, neon blue accents, dark theme, smooth transitions, and premium components.

USE THIS MONGODB CONNECTION STRING IN THE BACKEND:
"mongodb+srv://root:123@ecom-bd.irltfst.mongodb.net/?appName=ecom-bd"

========================== REQUIREMENTS ==========================

1. GLOBAL UI + LAYOUT
- Single animated dashboard layout: sidebar + navbar + main content.
- Dark theme with neon-blue gradients.
- Framer Motion animations everywhere: fade, slide, scale, hover-lift.
- React Router for navigation.
- Axios for API calls.
- Lazy loading + animated page transitions.

2. PAGES

A. DASHBOARD (E-commerce Analytics)
- Stat cards: total sales, revenue, active users, orders (count-up animation).
- Animated charts:
  • Line chart → monthly revenue trend.
  • Bar chart → sales by country.
  • Pie chart → category distribution.
- Recent orders table.
- Optional 3D glowing globe (react-globe.gl).

B. PRODUCT LIST PAGE
- Animated category sidebar.
- Search bar.
- Animated product card grid (hover lift + glow).
- Product details modal with zoom animation.

C. OPTIONAL PRODUCT ADMIN PAGE

3. BACKEND (Node + Express + MongoDB)
- Product model with fields:
  name, category, price, stock, rating, imageUrl, description, createdAt.
- CRUD routes.
- Use the provided MongoDB URL.
- Use Express controllers + routes folder structure.

4. DUMMY DATA (100 PRODUCTS)
Generate exactly 100 product objects:
- categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances, Sports, Accessories
- price: 100–50000
- stock: 1–300
- rating: 1–5
- imageUrl: placeholder URLs
- description: short summaries
Output valid JSON.

5. FOLDER STRUCTURE
client/
  src/components/
  src/pages/
  src/layout/
  src/charts/
  src/theme/
server/
  models/
  routes/
  controllers/

6. FINAL OUTPUT
Generate:
- All React components
- All animated UI
- All backend models + routes
- The theme file
- The chart components
- The sidebar + layout
- The dashboard analytics page
- The product listing page
- The JSON dummy data

Everything must look like a premium animated Vision UI dashboard.
